### A Fullstack Todo-List Web Application using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React and Node.js

#### The technologies used for the Fullstack App consists of PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js and added some Bootstrap to bring some life into the design.  

#### I also used React Hooks for my front-end which involves React Hooks being the useState and useEffect. For my backend, I built my server in Node.js using Express. I then built a RESTful API in Node.js using Express to handle the HTTP requests and send it over to the PostgreSQL database to then perform CRUD operations and the RESTful API would take that data back and respond back to the client with the requested data. 

#### My plans are to either deploy the front-end on Netlify and the backend on Heroku or just have the entire application on Heroku. 





#### FEATURES:
#### 1. Add a task.
#### 2. Edit a task.

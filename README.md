### A Full-Stack To-do List Web Application using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React and Node.js

#### The technologies used for the Fullstack App consists of PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js and added some Bootstrap to bring some life into the design.  

#### I also used React Hooks for my front-end involving the useState and the useEffect. For my backend, I built my server in Node.js using Express. I then built a RESTful API in Node.js using Express to handle the HTTP requests and send it over to the PostgreSQL database to then perform CRUD operations and the RESTful API would take that data back and respond back to the client with the requested data. 

How to use:
### 1. Clone repository
### 2. In your terminal, change directory to server. (cd server) 
### 3. Run Nodemon index
### 4. Create another terminal whilst index.js is running 
### 5. cd ..
### 6. cd client 
### 7. npm start

#### 2. Edit any tasks and will be recorded in the Database ✔
#### 3. Delete any task ✔
